testNoAlerts:

Purpose: To verify that the AlertGenerator does not generate false alerts when all patient data is within normal ranges.
Justification: Ensures the system does not overreact to normal conditions, maintaining user trust and system reliability.
testAbnormalDataAlerts:

Purpose: To check if the AlertGenerator correctly identifies and generates alerts for abnormal patient data values.
Justification: Validates that the alert system is functioning correctly and capable of flagging critical health issues.
testAbnormalTrendsInData:

Purpose: To assess the system's ability to detect abnormal trends over time in patient data.
Justification: Trend detection is important for early diagnosis and prevention of worsening conditions, ensuring timely medical intervention.
testHypoxia:

Purpose: To verify the alert generation for conditions related to low oxygen levels in the blood.
Justification: Hypoxia is a serious condition, and the system must be able to identify and alert healthcare providers immediately.
testBloodPressureStrategy:

Purpose: To validate that the BloodPressureStrategy correctly identifies abnormal blood pressure readings and generates appropriate alerts.
Justification: Blood pressure is a critical health indicator, and accurate alerts for hypertension or hypotension are essential for patient safety.
testHeartRateStrategy:

Purpose: To ensure the HeartRateStrategy generates alerts for abnormal heart rate readings.
Justification: Heart rate anomalies, such as bradycardia or tachycardia, need to be promptly detected and addressed.
testHypotensiveHypoxemiaStrategy:

Purpose: To check the detection of combined hypotension and hypoxemia conditions.
Justification: This strategy is essential for identifying patients at risk of severe hypoxemic conditions, which require immediate medical attention.
testOxygenSaturationStrategy:

Purpose: To verify that low oxygen saturation levels are correctly identified and alerted by the system.
Justification: Low oxygen saturation can lead to critical conditions; hence, accurate detection and alerting are crucial for patient care.
addPatientData_storesDataCorrectly:

Purpose: To ensure that patient data is stored correctly in the DataStorage.
Justification: Proper data storage is foundational for accurate data retrieval and subsequent analysis.
getRecords_filtersRecordsByTime:

Purpose: To test that DataStorage filters patient records correctly based on the given time range.
Justification: Ensures that the system retrieves the correct subset of data, which is crucial for accurate monitoring and alert generation.
getAllPatients_returnsAllPatients:

Purpose: To verify that DataStorage correctly returns all stored patients.
Justification: Validates the integrity and completeness of patient data management.
addRecord_addsRecordCorrectly:

Purpose: To confirm that adding a record to a patient works as expected.
Justification: Ensures individual patient records are managed correctly, supporting accurate health tracking.
