Data Management Diagram

This diagram illustrates the DataStorage class responsible for storing, retrieving, 
and deleting patient data, alongside the PatientData class that holds the patient-specific information, 
and the DataRetriever which fetches patient data based on ID. 
This setup ensures comprehensive data management and easy retrieval for analysis.




Patient Identification Diagram

This diagram depicts how patient data is linked to their respective profiles. 
The PatientIdentifier class matches incoming data with existing patient records (PatientRecord).
 The IdentityManager handles data integrity and impersonation issues, 
ensuring accurate patient identification and management.



Alert Generation Diagram

The alert generation system is shown with the AlertGenerator continuously monitoring patient data.
 It processes data against predefined thresholds, generating alerts (Alert) which are managed by AlertManager. 
Devices send data to the AlertGenerator, ensuring real-time monitoring and timely alerts for critical conditions.



Access Control Diagram

This diagram outlines the security mechanisms with the SecurityCheck class,
 which controls access to the data storage system. 
It ensures only authorized personnel can access sensitive patient data, 
maintaining data security and privacy.



Alert Sequence Diagram

This diagram illustrates the sequence of interactions for generating an alert in a cardiovascular health monitoring system.
 The process begins with a device sending patient data to the AlertGenerator.
 The AlertGenerator evaluates this data, stores it, and checks for trends in the DataStorage.
If a critical condition is detected, the AlertGenerator notifies the AlertManager.
 The AlertManager then sends the alert to the medical staff. 
The medical staff acknowledges the alert and takes the necessary actions. 
If no critical condition is detected, the system repeats the monitoring process
